# Distribution_Analysis
Analyze the distribution of separate components in mesh file

The script will grab a mesh file (currently only in .obj format), separate it's disconnected components, find the distance to each components nearest neighbor, then print a histogram. 
This script has only been used for a select purpose so there are hard-coded values that will need changed if used elsewhere.
